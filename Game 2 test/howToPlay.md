* One player may see only the computer screen and navigates through the maze
* the other players may only look at the MAP and have to give directions to the 
  player.
* The green square is the goal, street lights and pastebins should help you 
  locate the spawning position.
* You have to reach the goal before your beer gets to warm. (at 15Â°C)
